        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Jerald</strong>. I’m passionate about clean code, problem-solving, and constantly improving my craft. I love working on hands-on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. My goal is to create websites that are not only functional but also visually appealing and accessible to all users.</p>

        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <p>I’m currently a student at ACLC College of Mandaue, where I’m studying web development and gaining hands-on experience in coding. My time here has helped me build a strong foundation in the technical skills I need to succeed as a web developer.</p>

        <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new programming languages or hiking local trails. I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills, while also balancing my personal interests and hobbies.</p>
